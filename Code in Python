###Above is the code used in order to use random effects and the values given for passengers
arriving per minute (5), then going into the boarding pass queue, and then after using a the
distribution to assign a random service time, the passenger is then sent into the personal
checking queue. After that queue, that personal checking process has a certain amount of time
assigned to completion as well. We are looking at the number of people checking boarding pass
and number of machines at checking to see how we can optimize this queue. This simulation is
useful to see how the amount of time people are taking affects the queue and the total number
of people that eventually pass through these queues. From a passenger perspective, we can
also understand the impact of “choosing” the right line in order to get through the queues earlier
than those who came before you.###
